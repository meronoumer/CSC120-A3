- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
   Maylynn Rodriguez,Boushilah Mata


- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended TA hours on Sunday afternoons from 1-3 pm and 7-9 pm.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I initially found it taxing since it was much longer to write than Python but I really like it now since it's more declarative - in that since there is a lot to be written out , i can understand exactly what everything is doing. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Since, I realized that to solve most of these problems , I was still applying a lot of similar concepts from Python to Java but with different syntax -it helped me realize that a lot of the concepts are similar across programming languages.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Entertaining different ways to solve an issue instead of solely sticking to the method I had started with worked. Taking breaks and starting early also worked as it helped me get unstuck a lot. It didn't work to sit down and attempt the problem alone. It was also much harder to do the harder portions of this assignment so I would recommend following the order of the rubric.
